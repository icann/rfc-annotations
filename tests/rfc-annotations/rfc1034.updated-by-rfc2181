<pre>
RFC1034, in section 3.7, indicates that the authority section of an
authoritative answer may contain the SOA record for the zone from
which the answer was obtained.  When discussing negative caching,
RFC1034 section 4.3.4 refers to this technique but mentions the
additional section of the response.  The former is correct, as is
implied by the example shown in section 6.2.5 of RFC1034.  SOA
records, if added, are to be placed in the authority section.
