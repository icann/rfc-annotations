#C RFC 7766 clarifies TCP reordering
#L 1721
<p>
@@RFC7766@@ describes the implementation requirements for DNS over TCP.
Section 7 of RFC 7766 says:
<br>
<pre>
RFC 1035 is ambiguous on the question of whether TCP responses may be
reordered -- the only relevant text is in Section 4.2.1, which
relates to UDP:

	 Queries or their responses may be reordered by the network, or by
	 processing in name servers, so resolvers should not depend on them
	 being returned in order.

For the avoidance of future doubt, this requirement is clarified.
Authoritative servers and recursive resolvers are RECOMMENDED to
support the preparing of responses in parallel and sending them out
of order, regardless of the transport protocol in use.  Stub and
recursive resolvers MUST be able to process responses that arrive in
a different order than that in which the requests were sent,
regardless of the transport protocol in use.
