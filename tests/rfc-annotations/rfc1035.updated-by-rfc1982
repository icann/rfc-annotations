#C RFC 1982 has a better definition of serial number arithmetic
#L 1023
<p>@@RFC1982@@ clarifies how serial number arithmetic should be performed.
The abstract says "The DNS has long relied upon serial number arithmetic,
a concept which has never really been defined, certainly not in an
IETF document, though which has been widely understood.  This memo
supplies the missing definition."
