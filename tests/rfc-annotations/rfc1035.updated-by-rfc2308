#C RFC 2308 adds $TTL to the master file format 
#L 1805
<p>
Section 4 of @@RFC2308@@ says:
<br>
<pre>
The Master File format [RFC 1035 Section 5] is extended to include
the following directive:

$TTL <TTL> [comment]

All resource records appearing after the directive, and which do not
explicitly include a TTL value, have their TTL set to the TTL given
in the $TTL directive.  SIG records without a explicit TTL get their
TTL from the "original TTL" of the SIG record [RFC 2065 Section 4.5].
