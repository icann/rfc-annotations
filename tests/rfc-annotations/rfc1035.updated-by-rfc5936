#C RFC 5936 re-specifies how AXFR works
#L 1780
<p>
@@RFC5936@@ is a complete re-definition of AXFR. Its abstract says:
"The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby
forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions,
impeding interoperability.  Yet today we have a satisfactory set of
implementations that do interoperate.  This document is a new
definition of AXFR -- new in the sense that it records an accurate
definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism."
